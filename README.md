## Before You Get Started
You'll need the token if you copy the entire code include
the index. To get the token you'll need to go to https://discord.com/developers
and get the token for your bot. With this create a new file named: config.json and
input the following:
```
{
    "token": "TOKEN_ID_HERE",
    "prefix": "DESIRED_PREFIX"
}
```

Note that the prefix will be "hard coded" and cannot be changed via discord with
what is all here.

Additional information for what you may need, how to get these,
